Group Name: Project Tetris

Period: 2

Our project is a remake of Tetris, a game in which a player decides where to place a randomized tetromino (made of blocks) as it falls to the bottom of the grid. The tetrominoes should line up to fill a horizontal line on the grid.
When a line is filled, it clears, and the blocks above fall down to fill the empty line. When a tetromino is placed and a part of it is above the top of the grid, the game ends. The game will award 100 points per line cleared. Every 300 points,
the level increases, and the blocks fall faster. There is a counter for score and level on the screen. The goal is to reach as many points as possible.
